          <h1>üèÜ xdcGotcha ‚Äî The XDC Blockchain's First Persistent NFT Mood Agent</h1>
          
          <p>xdcGotcha is the XDC blockchain's first AI-powered NFT agent that analyzes wallet flows, mints dynamic NFTs, and expresses "mood" based on real on-chain behavior. Powered by a persistent, self-aware AI agent, xdcGotcha transforms wallets into living digital pets, giving every user a visual and narrative reflection of their wallet's financial health, trends, and emotional state.</p>

          <h2>Theme: XDC RWAi Agents</h2>
          
          <p>xdcGotcha is an autonomous AI agent for XDC that constantly analyzes wallet activity, tracks financial flows, and issues a living NFT that evolves its mood and story based on your on-chain performance. Every Gotchi NFT reflects real wallet inflows, outflows, and USD profit/loss, with on-chain pricing provided by GoPlugin oracles. AI-generated summaries and persistent memory make every Gotchi more than just a token‚Äîit's a personal, emotional dashboard for your blockchain life.</p>

          <h3>On-chain Analytics:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Scans every block for any XDC address, reconstructing monthly inflows and outflows</li>
            <li>Converts flows to USD using GoPlugin's XDC/USDT oracle, with historical accuracy</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>NFT Mood Engine:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Mints a Gotchi NFT for each wallet</li>
            <li>Updates the NFT's mood as wallet conditions change‚Äîusing an agent logic based on inflow recency and net profit/loss</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Autonomous AI Agent:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The agent schedules its own analysis, logs its thoughts, and keeps a running journal of every mood change and summary</li>
            <li>All summaries are generated by OpenAI GPT-4o, so the narrative evolves as your blockchain story unfolds</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Excited:</strong> Inflow in the last 24h + net gain > $20</li>
            <li><strong>Happy:</strong> Inflow in last 3 days + net gain > $5</li>
            <li><strong>Content:</strong> Inflow in last week</li>
            <li><strong>Anxious:</strong> Inflow in last 7-30 days</li>
            <li><strong>Hungry:</strong> No inflow in 30+ days</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The agent checks these conditions for every wallet, every time it analyzes.</p>
